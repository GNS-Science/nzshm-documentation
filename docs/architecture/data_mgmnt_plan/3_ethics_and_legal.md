## 3 Ethics and Legal Compliance

### 3.1 How will you manage any ethical issues?

??? note "Questions to consider:"

    Have you gained consent for data preservation and sharing?
    How will you protect the identity of participants if required? e.g. via anonymization
    How will sensitive data be handled to ensure it is stored and transferred securely?
    Ethical issues affect how you store data, who can see/use it and how long it is kept. Managing ethical concerns may include: anonymization of data; referral to departmental or institutional ethics committees; and formal consent agreements. You should show that you are aware of any issues and have planned accordingly. If you are carrying out research involving human participants, you must also ensure that consent is requested to allow data to be shared and reused.

No known sensitive datasets are included in this project.

### 3.2 How will you manage copyright and Intellectual Property Rights (IP/IPR) issues?

??? note "Questions to consider:"

    Who owns the data?
    How will the data be licensed for reuse?
    Are there any restrictions on the reuse of third-party data?
    Will data sharing be postponed / restricted e.g. to publish or seek patents?
    State who will own the copyright and IPR of any data that you will collect or create, along with the licence(s) for its use and reuse. For multi-partner projects, IPR ownership may be worth covering in a consortium agreement. Consider any relevant funder, institutional, departmental or group policies on copyright or IPR. Also consider permissions to reuse third-party data and any restrictions needed on data sharing.

Copyright and IP rights are handled per the NZ NSHM IP Management Plan.
